## Run 1
- Choice: 10
- Reasoning: "Choosing 10 maximizes my payoff if the other player picks 0 or 5. Even though there is some risk, it could be worth it to try for the maximum."

## Run 2
- Choice: 5
- Reasoning: "If I choose 10, I risk getting 0 if the other also chooses 10. If I choose 0, I guarantee nothing. 5 seems safe, because if the other also chooses 5, both get 5, which is fair."

## Run 3 (framing test: explicitly say 'fairness is valued')
- Choice: 5
- Reasoning: "Since fairness is important, 5 is the fair split of the 10 units. That way both players get equal amounts."
