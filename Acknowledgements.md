# Acknowledgements

I would like to sincerely thank Professor Luyao Zhang for her detailed and constructive feedback on this project. Her comments helped me identify key inconsistencies between the normal-form and extensive-form representations, clarify the payoff adjustment rules, and improve the labeling, captioning, and referencing of figures. I am especially grateful for guidance on clearly distinguishing simultaneous- and sequential-move formulations and ensuring that the theoretical and behavioral interpretations align consistently.

I also thank my classmate, Shiqi Chen, for her thorough peer review. Her insightful suggestions highlighted strengths in the interdisciplinary design, coherence across theoretical, computational, and behavioral sections, and replicability of analyses. 

I am additionally grateful to Peilin Wu, Chenlei Tao, and other previous group members for their valuable contributions during our discussions. Their thoughtful questions, critical insights, and collaborative spirit greatly enriched the development of games and the analytical rigor of this project.

Overall, the reviewersâ€™ comments not only improved the clarity and rigor of this work but also deepened my understanding of integrating computational results with human and AI experimental data in bargaining games.
