# Economist Component

## Summary
This folder contains the theoretical component of the project, including:

- Definitions of equilibrium concepts (e.g., Nash, SPNE, Bayes–Nash)  
- Existence theorems and brief proof ideas  
- Characterization of equilibrium outcomes (e.g., fairness, efficiency)  
- Notes on limitations or assumptions of models
