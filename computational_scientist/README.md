# Computational Scientist Component

## Colab Notebook
- File: ProblemSet1_2a.ipynb
- This notebook is exported from Google Colab and contains all computational analyses for the project.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to run the notebook:

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Make sure you are signed in with a Google account.
3. To execute all cells:
   - Click Runtime â†’ Run all
   - Or run each cell manually by clicking the play button on the left of each cell.
4. Ensure the required Python packages are installed (most should already be included in Colab):
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - Any other packages listed in the first cell
5. Optionally, you can modify input parameters in the notebook to explore different scenarios.

> Note: This notebook reproduces all computational experiments, including data processing, simulations, and analysis relevant to the project.
