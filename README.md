# COMSCI-ECON-206 ProblemSet1

## Abstract
This project explores the interdisciplinary study of economic theory, computational analysis, and behavioral science applied to the assigned problem set. The goal is to combine theoretical modeling, simulation, and experimental insights to better understand decision-making processes.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

COMSCI-ECON-206-Problem-Set-1/
├── README.md # Project overview and abstract
├── economist/ # Theoretical models, notes, GTE files, screenshots
├── computational_scientist/ # Code, simulations, oTree applications
└── behavioral_scientist/ # Experimental data, observations, notes


## Reproduction Steps
1. Open the respective subfolder for the content you want to review.
2. Economist: Refer to notes, GTE files, and screenshots for theoretical analysis.
3. Computational Scientist: Run notebooks or oTree applications as documented.
4. Behavioral Scientist: Review experiment data and related notes.

## Notes
- README.md will be updated as the project progresses.
- Ensure that all files are properly organized within their corresponding folders.
